# Curf n Surf  
COVID-19 is upon us and Cyprus is taking strict measures to contain the virus.  

Everybody should #stayhome but in case of absolutely necessity, people are required to request permission for 
moving outside using a standard SMS template, to which an automated reply grants or declines permission to do so.  
"Curf n Surf" automates this process.

The app just creates the message and starts an Intent for the standard SMS handler on the user's phone.  
Available in Greek and English.
